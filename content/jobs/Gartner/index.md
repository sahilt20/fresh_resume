- Engineered AWS infrastructure with Terraform because Infrastructure-as-Code beats Infrastructure-as-Screenshots every time. Automated environment provisioning so developers stop asking "can I have a server?" and start deploying. Turns out "serverless" still needs someone who knows what servers do
- Built serverless data pipelines using AWS Lambda, SNS, SQS, AWS Glue, and Airflow that process data while I sleep. Orchestrated workflows that actually flow instead of becoming data traffic jams in random S3 buckets. Event-driven architecture: because polling is so 2010
- Implemented Python OOP patterns and design principles to write code that doesn't make future-me cry. Six months from now, "clever code" shouldn't require a PhD to understandâ€”maintainability over cleverness, always
- Conducted code reviews on Bitbucket with the diplomatic precision of a UN negotiator. Established coding standards while diplomatically avoiding "what were you thinking?" Everyone's code improved, nobody quit
- Collaborated with Product and UX teams to translate "make it faster" into actual technical solutions. Mastered the art of saying "technically possible, but..." in ways that don't crush product dreams while staying realistic
