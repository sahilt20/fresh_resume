- Automated workflows with Informatica Scheduler using assignment tasks, event waits, and event raisesâ€”basically teaching workflows to manage themselves. Job scheduling that runs like clockwork, minus the manual clock-winding
- Developed complex SQL queries with unions and multi-table joins that actually finish running before the heat death of the universe. Created database views that made querying data less painful for everyone downstream
- Built Tableau dashboards that turned raw data into stories business stakeholders could understand without a statistics degree. Data visualization: the art of making numbers interesting to people who hate numbers
- Mastered troubleshooting and root cause analysis by independently hunting down data issues before they escalated into executive escalations. Solved problems that made other people say "that's impossible" until I showed them the fix
