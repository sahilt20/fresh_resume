- Automated report generation with Python scripts and bot integrations because manually generating reports at 9 AM daily is not anyone's idea of fulfillment. Now bots handle the morning ritual while humans handle actual problems
- Built CLI tools with Argparse and Click that let users actually interact with data pipelines instead of begging the data team for spreadsheets. Command-line interfaces: making data accessible one --help flag at a time
- Designed data pipelines with ELK stack, Kafka, Oracle, and Python that process metrics in real-time. Logs flow, data transforms, insights emerge—no manual intervention required (exactly as automation intended)
- Developed anomaly detection model using K-means clustering that spots weird patterns before they become production incidents. Machine learning: because humans are terrible at spotting outliers in millions of data points
- Leveraged Dask for large-scale system reconciliation, proving that Python can handle big data when you give it the right tools. Processed datasets too large for Pandas to even think about
- Migrated Pandas scripts to PySpark because "it's running for 6 hours" is not acceptable. Improved execution speed from glacial to reasonable while keeping the data science team happy
- Mastered ETL integration patterns with Python on Apache Spark. Data profiling, transformation, and cleansing at scale—making messy telecom data actually usable for analytics
