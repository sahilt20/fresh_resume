- Architected enterprise CI/CD infrastructure on Azure DevOps that deploys code while humans do human things (like debating tabs vs spaces). Implemented Infrastructure-as-Code because clicking buttons doesn't scale. Boosted deployment efficiency by 25%, which marketing would call "revolutionary" but I call "using Git properly"
- Built YAML-based pipeline framework with reusable templates, eliminating the copy-paste disaster that plagued our repos. Saved 400+ hours annually that developers now spend writing better code instead of babysitting deployments
- Standardized cloud resource naming conventions across the organization—"prod-server-v2-FINAL-actually-final" is now illegal. Achieved 40% reduction in deployment issues by enforcing Azure best practices and occasionally wielding the veto hammer
- Developed automated pipeline builder integrating Azure Boards and ServiceNow, because manually approving 50 deployments daily builds character (the wrong kind). Change management now happens automatically while I focus on actual engineering
- Designed DevOps pipelines for SAP HANA environments, teaching legacy systems modern CI/CD tricks. Turns out you can teach old databases new deployment strategies—it just takes more Git branching models than expected
- Built comprehensive DevOps pipelines for MuleSoft integration platform where APIs connect, transform, and occasionally misbehave. Implemented automated testing because "it worked in dev" doesn't count as a deployment strategy
- Created Tableau site migration pipelines with zero-downtime deployments—executive dashboards going dark during earnings calls is a career-ending move. Data visualizations now migrate seamlessly, pie charts intact
- Developed PowerShell automation framework that provisions Azure infrastructure faster than meetings can be scheduled. My scripts work harder than I do, exactly as the automation gods intended
