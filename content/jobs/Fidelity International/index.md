- Built CI/CD pipelines with Bamboo, Docker, Jenkins, and UrbanCode Deploy that automated the "works on my machine" problem out of existence. Deployments now happen with one click instead of a 47-step wiki article. Developers stopped hoarding working environments like dragons hoarding gold
- Developed AWS Lambda functions using AWS CDK because Infrastructure-as-Code beats Infrastructure-as-Screenshots-in-Confluence. Functions deploy automatically and scale infinitely (within AWS budget limits). Serverless: because managing servers is someone else's problem now
- Championed Agile/Scrum methodologies by running standups that actually stood up, and retrospectives where teams learned instead of vented. Promoted continuous improvement while ruthlessly eliminating continuous meetings that could've been emails
- Built data pipelines using Python, Apache NiFi, Control-M, Snowflake, and Oracle that herd data from point A to point B without it escaping. Orchestrated workflows that flow smoothly instead of becoming data puddles in forgotten databases
- Developed API code generation framework with Flask and FastAPI because writing 50 identical endpoints manually is the path to madness. Automated the repetitive parts so developers could focus on solving actual problems
- Wrote SQL queries that finish running before coffee gets cold. Optimized database performance with strategic indexes and eliminating "SELECT * FROM everything" queries. DBAs stopped sending passive-aggressive emails, mission accomplished
- Transformed raw data into insights that business stakeholders actually understood and used. Implemented analytics frameworks that answer questions people didn't know they should askâ€”basically data fortune-telling, but with Python
